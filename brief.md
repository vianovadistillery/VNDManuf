# TPManuf → Modern App (Cursor Build Brief, Consolidated)

This repository contains a **Cursor-ready plan and starter code** to convert the legacy **QuickBASIC TPManuf** system into a modern Python application with API + UI, typed domain, data migration, and golden tests for legacy print artifacts.

> **Units Convention (confirmed):** Use **kg** and **L** for quantities; where ABV appears, treat it as a **% by volume** and convert to mass using product **density (kg/L)** when needed. Canonical storage is **kg** (mass).

---

## 1. Target Stack

- Language: **Python 3.12**
- API: **FastAPI**
- UI: **Dash** (operations/admin), text-first renderers for reports (PDF added later)
- DB: **SQLite (dev)**, **Postgres (prod)** via SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- Tests: **pytest** (+ golden-file tests for print outputs)
- Tooling: **uv/poetry (choose one)**, **ruff/black**, **pre-commit**, **GitHub Actions**
- Docs: **MkDocs (optional)** with Mermaid diagrams (kept under `docs/`)

Everything should be runnable with three commands:

```bash
make setup
make migrate
make run
```

---

## 2. System Overview

TPManuf manages trade-paints manufacturing: formulations (recipes), colour variants, work orders, batch tickets, QC capture, inventory (FIFO), purchasing, despatch, **sales orders & pricing**, **packaging hierarchy (CAN→4PK→CTN)**, and **invoicing**. The goal is feature parity with improved data integrity, traceability, and modern UI.

**Top Day‑1 Tasks**: Products & formulas, create/release WOs, capture batches + QC, inventory receipts/issues, pricing, SOs → shipments → invoices, stock/valuation and usage reports, migration & reconciliation.

---

## 3. Legacy Audit & Behaviour Map

`scripts/legacy_audit.py` will:
- Parse `.BAS/.BI`: entry points, SHARED vars, ON ERROR paths.
- Identify all `OPEN/GET/PUT` usages and record layouts (LEN, FIELD statements).
- Catalogue print/report routines (tickets, invoices). Detect printer control codes.
- Discover pricing structures and any pack conversions in legacy data.
- Emit: `docs/legacy/legacy_mapping.csv` + per-file YAML specs used by migration.

**Preliminary Map**

| Legacy | New Module | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MAIN.BAS` | `app/api/main.py` + `app/ui` | API + web UI replace menu loop |
| `FORMULA.BAS` | `app/services/formulas.py` | CRUD + versioning |
| `BATCH.BAS` | `app/services/batching.py` | WO→Batch workflow |
| `INVENT.BAS` | `app/services/inventory.py` | FIFO ledger |
| `PO.BAS` | `app/services/purchasing.py` | Suppliers/POs/receipts |
| `SO.BAS` | `app/services/sales.py` | Sales orders/despatch |
| `PRICE*.BAS` | `app/services/pricing.py` | price resolution (customer → list) |
| `PACK*.BAS` | `app/services/packing.py` | can/4pk/ctn conversions |
| `INV*.BAS` | `app/services/invoicing.py` | invoice + print |
| `REPORTS.BAS` | `app/reports/*.py` | Jinja2/text renderers |

## 4. Domain Model & Schema (Authoritative)

### ERD (Mermaid)
```mermaid
erDiagram
  PRODUCT ||--o{ PRODUCT_VARIANT : has
  PRODUCT ||--o{ FORMULA : uses_default
  FORMULA ||--o{ FORMULA_LINE : consists_of
  PRODUCT ||--o{ INVENTORY_LOT : creates
  INVENTORY_LOT ||--o{ INVENTORY_TXN : has

  WORK_ORDER ||--o{ WORK_ORDER_LINE : contains
  WORK_ORDER ||--o{ BATCH : produces
  BATCH ||--o{ BATCH_COMPONENT : consumes
  BATCH ||--o{ QC_RESULT : records

  SUPPLIER ||--o{ PURCHASE_ORDER : issues
  PURCHASE_ORDER ||--o{ PO_LINE : includes

  CUSTOMER ||--o{ SALES_ORDER : places
  SALES_ORDER ||--o{ SO_LINE : includes
  SALES_ORDER ||--o{ INVOICE : bills
  INVOICE ||--o{ INVOICE_LINE : includes

  PRICE_LIST ||--o{ PRICE_LIST_ITEM : has
  CUSTOMER ||--o{ CUSTOMER_PRICE : overrides

  PRODUCT ||--o{ PACK_CONVERSION : defines
  PACK_UNIT ||--o{ PACK_CONVERSION : participates
```

### DDL
> See `db/alembic/` migrations driven from SQLAlchemy models (to be generated by Cursor). The schema includes: products, variants, formulas/lines, inventory lots/txns (FIFO), WOs, batches, QC, suppliers/POs, customers/SOs, **invoices**, **pricing** (lists + overrides), **pack units** & **conversions**.

---

## 5. Units, Conversions, and ABV (Confirmed)

- **Canonical storage**: mass in **kg**.  
- **Liquids**: if ingested in **L**, convert to **kg** using `kg = L * density(kg/L)`.
- **ABV %**: volume fraction; when mass is required, convert via density of the liquid (e.g., ethanol/water mixture or product density); store ABV as `%` field alongside mass.
- **Rounding**: quantities to **3 dp**, money to **2 dp**; bankers’ rounding at commit.

---

## 6. Data Migration Plan

- Per-file spec YAMLs from audit: field name, offset/length, type, scale.
- Migration order: products → formulas/lines → suppliers/customers → pricing → pack units/conversions → inventory lots → inventory txns → WOs/batches/QC → SOs → invoices.
- Idempotent upserts using natural keys (SKU, codes). Emit `out/audit.csv` + `out/anomalies/*.csv`.
- Reconcile counts and numeric totals within **±0.1%**; fail CI if exceeded.

**Fixed-width parser example** in `app/adapters/legacy_io.py`.

---

## 7. API & UI Spec (Highlights)

- Products, Formulas, Inventory (FIFO), Work Orders, Batches (+QC), Purchasing, Sales Orders, **Pricing** (`/pricing/resolve`), **Packing** (`/pack/convert`), **Invoices** (`/invoices`, `/invoices/{id}/print?format=text|pdf`).

UI pages: Dash tables/forms for all above, plus print preview.

---

## 8. Reports & Golden Tests

**Fixtures** (already included):
- `fixtures/print/B060149.PRN` (batch ticket sample)
- `fixtures/print/00086633.INS` (invoice sample)

**Normalizer** strips legacy printer control codes and normalizes whitespace.  
Golden tests compare **normalized text** from new renderers to legacy fixtures.

---

## 9. Security, Logging, and CI

- Local JWT roles: Operator, Planner, Admin.
- JSON logging with request IDs.
- GitHub Actions CI: lint, test, build.

---

## 10. Roadmap

- M0 Repo+CI → M1 Schema+Audit → M2 Migration MVP → **M2.5 Pricing+Pack** → M3 Core Services → M4 UI+Reports (goldens) → M5 UAT+Cutover.

---

## 11. Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] Schema + migrations apply; migration script idempotent.  
- [ ] All legacy files mapped (or deprecated) in `docs/legacy/legacy_mapping.csv`.  
- [ ] Pricing, Packaging, Invoicing operational.  
- [ ] Golden tests pass for batch ticket and invoice (text mode).  
- [ ] Stock balances & valuation reconcile within ±0.1%.
